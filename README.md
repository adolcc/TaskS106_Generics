**Java Generics: A Practical Overview**

This repository demonstrates the use of Generics in Java, a key feature for writing flexible, type-safe, and reusable code. Generics allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on various types while ensuring compile-time type checking.

---
**Exercises:**

NoGenericMethods: Explores handling multiple arguments of the same type without generics, highlighting the need for explicit casting.

GenericMethods (Basic): Introduces generic methods to safely process diverse argument types (Persona, String, Integer).

GenericMethods (Mixed): Shows how to combine both generic and specific (non-generic) type arguments within a method.

GenericMethods (Varargs): Illustrates using generic varargs (T...) for methods that accept an indefinite number of arguments, including the @SafeVarargs annotation.
